- Xaero's Minimap and Worldmap are now optional independently of each other. Meaning all 4 combinations of having them or not will work. However, to use all features you still need to install both!
- Links with extra path elements are now handled correctly.
- It now works even if the player is invisible. But you need to have visited that dimension while being visible before. (The mapping gets saved to the config after that)
- Added a command to manually refresh markers and area markers. (They normally only refresh when the dimension changes)
