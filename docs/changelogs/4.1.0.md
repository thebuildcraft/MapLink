- fix "Rendersystem called from wrong thread" error spam
- improve config ui (by switching to the actual clothconfig api instead of autoconfig)
- add Chinese (Simplified) localization (Xinyang-Gao)
- replace VanillaGradle with ArchitecturyLoom (which will make developing easier ... and will hopefully not cause any problems ...)
