This is a small client mod that allows you to see other players from further away on servers and see online-map-markers in game.
It does this by getting the position data from Dynmap, Bluemap, Squaremap or Pl3xMap running on the server and displaying it with waypoints in [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [Worldmap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map).

The AFK display feature can be used without having a map mod installed.

### Features
- see player positions on Xaero's Minimap _(see more below)_ and Worldmap
- see online-map-markers in game
- AFK display in tab list
- configurable trough Modmenu and Cloth Config Api
- **==> [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/thebuildcraft/projects/1)**

### Supported Maps
- Dynmap
- Bluemap
- Squaremap

### How to use
You just have to add the server you want to use this mod on to the list in the config:<br>

And make sure to set the "map-type" correctly!
